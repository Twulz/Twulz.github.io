				<p>I completed two Final Year Projects for my Bachelor of Engineering (Mechatronics) and Computer Science degrees. </p> 
				<img alt="Final Year Projects" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/mechatronicsFYP/10_package_box.jpg">
				<p>For Mechatronics I was part of a 3-person team who built a Smart Home system which had the following features:
				<ul>
					<li>A Node.js server running on a Raspberry Pi (Linux).</li>
					<li>A SQL database to record the data also on the server.</li>
					<li>Automated testing on the server using Knex and Mocha.</li>
					<li>Communication with the modules via HTTP and a RESTful API.</li>
					<li>A package box module using ESP32 chips, a MFRC522 RFID reader, a keypad and a 16x2 screen connected using the I2C interface.</li>
					<li>A heating and cooling system implemented mainly by my groupmate which also used an ESP32 with a small fan and cooling pad.</li>
					<li>A garden watering system which actuated an electric water valve implemented by a groupmate.</li>
					<li>A lighting system also implemented by a groupmate.</li> 
				</ul></p>

				<p>For Computer Science I was part of a 10-person team who built a Smart Parking solution for a future of Smart Cities to allow people with disabilities to find, book and use car parking. I was on the back-end team and also implemented the hardware demo. The overall system had the following features:
					<ul>
						<li>A Node.js server.</li>
						<li>A SQL database.</li>
						<li>Automated testing with Knex and Mocha which integrated with Jenkins for a CI/CD pipeline.</li>
						<li>An Android app which communicated with the server using a RESTful API.</li>
						<li>An Angular web interface which also used the RESTful API allowing the configuration of the system.</li>
						<li>A hardware demo using ESP32s and small 9g servo motors to demonstrate the functionality of the whole system (...using Lego cars!).</li>
					</ul>
