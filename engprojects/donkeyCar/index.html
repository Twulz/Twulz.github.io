				<p>Donkeycar is an open source platform to convert small scale (remote control) cars into self-driving cars. Donkeycar written in Python and is most often used with a Raspberry Pi and PiCam controlling an RC car by manipulating both steering and throttle.

				After re-joining the hackerspacethis year I came across a group who are trying to get a DonkeyCar community going here in Melbourne. The first workshop these guys had run was for the Open Hardware Mini Conference in January and were now expanding to hopefully run a few more sessions on a more regular basis and other events such as race days to pit our DonkeyCars against each other!</p>
