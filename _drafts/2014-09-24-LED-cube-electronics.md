After successfully programming the chip and testing the cube connected using a breadboard, I connected the electronics using veroboard to make for a better display.

I used female to male connecting wires to connect the 16 wires to the cathodes and 4 male to male connecting wires to the anodes which were attached to the breadboard. The other components were connected in a logical fashion elsewhere on the board.

## Programming the ATMega16

In order to properly test the LED Cube, I had to program the AVR which was a major reason I wanted to undertake this particular iteration of an LED cube. I used the [supplied code from the instructable][Instructable] to first test the cube, to make sure I was programming the chip correctly.



All was working correctly on the breadboard, so I'll leave the big reveal of the working cube to the prettier vero-board version!
