I was actually on holiday in New Zealand when I researched and ordered my 3D printer. I had saved hard all year for the holiday and towards the end I realised I had more than enough left over to finally buy a printer!

I had originally intended to source my own parts to make a MendelMax 1.5+ when I began researching printers. This was back in 2012 when i first got into 3D printers and actually built a few Mendels on a volunteer weekend for building printers for schools. I got so far as starting to print my own parts on the printer at the HackerSpace before getting distracted with life, uni and everything.

The Original i3 MK2 had only just been released with the new PEI sheet on the heatbed. This tipped me over the edge and after reading many glowing reviews online I promptly put in my order and began the wait! There was a 3 week lead time when I ordered but I got the shipped and tracking notification only just over a week later. Less than a week after that the printer had arrived - just in time when I'd started back at uni!
