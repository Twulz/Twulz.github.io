I was actually on holiday in New Zealand when I researched and ordered my 3D printer. I had saved hard for the holiday and towards the end I realised I had more than enough left over to finally buy a printer!

I had originally intended to source my own parts to make a MendelMax 1.5+ when I began researching printers. This was back in 2012 when I first got into 3D printers and actually built a few Mendels on a volunteer weekend for building printers for schools. I got so far as starting to print my own parts on the printer at the HackerSpace in 2014 before getting distracted with life, uni and everything. So the project was put on hold until 2016!

The Original i3 MK2 had only just been released with the new PEI sheet on the heatbed. This tipped me over the edge and after reading many glowing reviews online I promptly put in my order and began the wait! There was a 3 week lead time when I ordered but I got the shipped and tracking notification only just over a week later. Less than a week after that the printer had arrived - just in time when I'd started back at uni!

I took my time with the build; spreading it out over two days for the actual build time. The instructions for this model are really very good and could easily be constructed within a day - I just wanted to take my time so as to minimise mistakes and just enjoy the making process. Check out the album for a number of progress shots.

The Mk2 comes with a few models pre-sliced and availabled on the provided SD card - including this batarang, because who doesn't like batman?

Also Hi! That's me, don't mind the robot dinosaur shooting laser beams, it's my favourite shirt!
