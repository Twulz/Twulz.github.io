The remainder of the parts only took a few days to arrive so I could get started on the main electronics involved in the build. I chose to test the circuit on a breadboard before soldering the more permanent solution onto Veroboard.

I used female to male connecting wires to connect the 16 wires to the cathodes and 4 male to male connecting wires to the anodes which were attached to the breadboard. The other components were connected in a logical fashion elsewhere on the board.

## Programming the ATMega16

In order to properly test the LED Cube, I had to program the AVR which was a major reason I wanted to undertake this particular iteration of an LED cube. I used the [supplied code from the instructable][Instructable] to first test the cube, to make sure I was programming the chip correctly.



All was working correctly on the breadboard, so I'll leave the big reveal of the working cube to the prettier vero-board version!
