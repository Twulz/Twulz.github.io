VEGEPOD 1

Today I wanted to post about my Christmas present - my new Vegepod.

The Vegepod is a garden bed which makes growing veggies and herbs incredibly easy with its self-watering-pot design and innovative mesh cover. It's as close to set-and-forget as you can get with a garden bed. It comes in three sizes (1m x 0.5m, 1m x 1m or 1m x 2m) with the mesh cover and optional trolley or stand. I opted to get the 1m x 1m with a trolley so I could move it around and experiment a little more.

The setup would normally be very straight-forward; Vegepod and some of their fans provide a number of guides on youTube to clarify the process and everything goes together quite nicely. I did run into trouble when I realised my kit had two extra [ALICIA] parts and was missing the [ALICIA]. There is a very active Vegepod community on Facebook [ALICIA] which helped me clarify that this was a mistake. But easy peasy I just went back to the nursery around the corner where I got the Vegepod et voila! A finished Vegepod.

Now there are a number of different recommendations on what to fill the pod with. The main school of thought seems to be a mix of perlite (often used in Hydroponics), quality potting mix and cow manure though Vegepod does offer guides on other configurations. Lurking on the facebook community shows me that others have had a lot of success with other mixes, though to steer clear of chicken manure as it often contains other contaminants including weeds.

So I went with the standard 50L perlite from a hydroponics supplier in Preston I found through eBay for my 1m x 1m pod along with 25L cow manure and 10x25L quality Potting mix for tomatoes/herbs from Bunnings. While filling up the pod I made sure to use a face mask to minimise the amount of nasties I would have otherwise inhaled - it's a recommended safety precaution whenever you pour potting mix - safety first guys, no-one wants to cough up potting mix!

Finally it was down to actually planting up my pod - lots of users grew from seed but given the time of year and I was hankering for some home-grown goodies I went with small punnets of herbs again from my favourite Saturday shopping trip - Bunnings. A big issue many people have with the pod is over-planting. I did some planning using the square-metre gardening method to try to minimise this but I did get too excited and planted too many anyway :P

I ended up with thyme, strawberries, italian parsley, curled parsley, basil, coriander, iceberg lettuce and cos lettuce. I also had some extra lettuce plants that wouldn't fit in the pod that I just potted up to put in my netted enclosure which will be a great experiment to compare the pod to growing in a pot.

And here it is! All planted up and ready to go, from here Vegepod recommends connecting up the spray nozzle for a good 10 minutes the first time just to fill up the reserviour, then water for about 5minutes per day for the first week (as it's a hot Australian summer right now!), or until you see the reservoir overflowing. After that it's just fill up as needed and/or to keep the plants cooled especially until their roots have reached down into the reservoir then it's time to sit back and enjoy the greenery! 



VEGEPOD 2
Vegepod progress update

Well my vegepod has gone absolutely NUTS, I actually can't even come close to keeping up with the amount of lettuce I'm producing, so I've actually taken out some of the lettuce and replaced it with spinach which I use every day, maybe I'll be able to keep up now!

There are a few things I'd like to note with the pod - the herbs have now grown so big that they poke out of the sides of the pod under the mesh, this might be an issue with introducing bugs which can just crawl up the bits poking out which I might have to keep an eye on.

Also the basil - this huge basil plant went really well until I noticed the underside of all the leaves were covered with downy mildew :( This is a disease which is exacerbated by warm, moisture-rich environments like that which is created by the pod. So I covered it with a plastic bag and ripped out the whole plant. It is recommended that you don't replant in the same position (so as to limit cross-contamination) but I don't have anywhere else! So against all recommendation I've planted some more basil because I love it and the damn possums can't get it in my pod and just hoping for the best while I watch it like a hawk.

A comparison between my pod and the normal net shelter - there is no comparison, the pod is absolutely loving life whereas life in the pot is looking a little sad. Lettuce is generally not great for pots however so that could have been a factor, but they both were watered equally with approximately the same amount of sun.

I absolutely love this pod, initially I wanted to get the Vegepod to eventually convert it into a Farmbot [ALICIA], but judging by how easy it has been so far to grow incredibly healthy and abundant plants I might not even need to go that far! 

I highly recommend the Vegepod to anybody who wants to grow their own veggies - especially in places like rentals or somewhere you might need to re/move it down the line, after the setup there's minimal work to do for such fantastically healthy plants, even now in the middle of summer. Definitely worth the investment!



HEXAPOD
In [ALICIA] I Kickstarted Vorpal's Hexapod as a great 3D printing project to get started into the world of hexapods, other servo-powered robots and ABS printing.

I was actually surprised by how quickly I got the robot as I hadn't even started printing the parts yet! These parts are very well designed for 3D printing, the overhangs on the parts are optimised for strength and I had no issues with difficult printing due to the parts themselves. Printing in ABS, however, was a different story. I had to do quite a bit of adjusting z-height just to get the part to stick to my heatbed, but after a few false starts I was able to dial it in and print the parts all in ABS.

DARK SOULS 2
With all my paints sorted I dove straight in to the painting. I decided to experiment a bit with the base coat colours - most of the mainly silver characters I went with grey but black is a really great way to make sure you get a good coat over the whole model, and sometimes if you don't spill paint all over the base it doesn't even need that much of a touch up too!

Ornstein and Smough were probably my favourite bosses in Dark Souls 1 so I wanted to do them justice and spent -ages- on their paint job. In the end I'm fairly happy with them, but I wish I left them to be one of the last so I could make the mistakes on the other models. After doing the sentinels though I am considering removing this bright gold colour in favour of a silver-grey base with highlights of gold - like how I did these sentinel bows.

The titanite demon was probably the easiest of the lot to paint - the washes and drybrush did most of the work for me and I think it turned out great!

DARK SOULS 3
This is just a short update on my painting progress for Dark Souls. I went on my annual summer holiday to Torquay for 2 weeks and naturally it was crappy weather as usual so woohoo for inside hobbies!

Anyway I was able to paint most of the rest of the base game figures, here you go!
