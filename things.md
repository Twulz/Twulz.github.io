I've split this site into a number of categories for my 'Things' as my hobbies run across quite a few disciplines.

## [Mechatronics Engineering Things](/things/mechatronics)
These Things cover robotics, electronics, 3D printing and all that fun stuff!

## [Software Engineering Things](/things/software)
These things are purely software projects - if they've got some hardware I put them under Mechatronics instead!

## [Garden Things](/things/garden)
These Things are projects for my garden, including building stuff and growing stuff!

## [Cosplay Things](/things/cosplay)
These Things are Cosplay props, armour and costumes.

## [Sewing Things](/things/sewing)
These Things are sewn projects, starting with useful household things.

## [General Making Things](/things/making)
These Things are all the other things I've made, so far I've been painting the miniatures that come in Board Games.
