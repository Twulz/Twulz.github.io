I've split this site into a number of categories for my 'Things' as my hobbies run across quite a few disciplines.

## [Mechatronics Engineering Things](/things/mechatronics/)
These Things cover robotics, electronics, 3D printing and all that fun stuff!

## [Software Engineering Things](/things/software/)
These things are purely software projects - if they've got some hardware I put them under Mechatronics instead!

## [Miniature Things](/things/mini/)
These Things are all things miniature, so far I've been painting the miniatures that come in Board Games.

## [Garden Things](/things/garden/)
These Things are projects for my garden, including building stuff and growing stuff!
