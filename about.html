				<p>Engineer, maker, hacker, crafter...
				<br>I basically just like to make things.</p>
				
				<p>I am a Mechatronics Engineering student in Melbourne, Australia and I also have about a billion hobbies which mostly revolve around "making stuff". I decided to create this blog both as yet another project for myself and to keep it all a little more organised. I really created this for myself so my apologies if it's not the greatest ever but I do hope one day somebody else will get something out of it!!</p>
