I attended a workshop through university to help the Laser Skirmish guys solder up their new laser tag guns.

Just a small post - I mainly made this post due to the following photo - it looks like some underground weapons bunker. But I can assure you, these are laser tag guns.

Here is one of the guns, we had the plans and just needed to wire it up and install the lens in the front.

It was a great day, we got all the guns working and were able to have a small game around their warehouse.
