I received the chassis for the MagBot and put it together.

The chassis kit came like this - with no padding, just like this in a plastic post bag so unsurprisingly the acrylic was snapped in multiple places.

I ended up gluing the parts that had snapped as I wasn't confident if I got a replacement that it would be padded correctly.

Here is one of the DC motors, I had to solder the leads on these first.

Here is a closeup of the front swivel wheel.

This chassis can be reused for a number of robot projects - MagBot can now continue!
