I kickstarted the Dark Souls Board Game and decided the minis would look much better painted.

## Making a Stand for Spray Painting

Before I could get started, I'd used my previous mini painting stand for another project and so first up I had to make some more! I got out my saw and workbench and cut some spare wood down to size.

I found it difficult last time to get some parts of the minis sprayed with the large wooden piece so I went with mainly smaller pieces but I still kept one piece big just in case I needed more stands.

I then ruled the lines and drilled holes at even intervals so they can be used either for a single mini, or to support some of the larger "miniatures".

## Priming the Minis

Now back to the painting - all the minis had to be washed in warm soapy water and dried off before priming.

### Priming Dark Souls

While I was priming the Horizon Zero Dawn miniatures I also decided to prep the next expansion pack for the Dark Souls Board Game too - so here are the nicely washed Darkroot Basin miniatures as well as the Gaping Dragon.

Here's a good example of using multiple screws to support some of the larger "miniatures".

I ran out of room on the prepped wood pieces so I cracked out some of the old egg cartons to hold some of the pieces too.

I primed these miniatures with the spray version of Citadel Chaos Black but the Plastidip I used to prime the [Skyrim Daggers]({% post_url 2020-10-31-skyrim-dagger-foam-smithing %}) is rubber based and can be seen peeling off the cardboard in my "spray booth".

### Priming Horizon Zero Dawn Minis

Now back to the Horizon Zero Dawn priming - I decided to use Citadel's Grey Seer primer spray for these ones are they are mostly light-coloured and I wanted to mix it up.

And just because I could - here's a close up of how detailed these figures are, and the size comparison between the smaller miniatures and the monsters. Next step is to let these dry and actually start painting!
