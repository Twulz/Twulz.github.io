## From the new printer

If you haven't read about my new 3D printer you can find the build - [part 1 here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-08-16-prusa3dPrinter-frame %}) and [part 2 here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-08-17-prusa3dPrinter-electronics %})!

Also I may have relocated the printer to my bathroom as it's the only room with a built in fan that would not annoy my housemates and allow me to get some sleep too! So yes, that is my toothbrush in the background!

...I think my photography skills leave a lot to be desired but you get the idea, it's quite a good quality print.
