title:  "Sourcing the LED Cube"

I built an LED cube that runs off a ATMega16 chip to experiment with these types of chips and have a bit of fun!

This was my first experience with sourcing my own materials for a project without the use of a kit, but I still did follow direct instructions from this [Fantastic Instructible](http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Cube-4x4x4/)

I decided to undertake this project after exams and as such didn't want to spend weeks waiting for parts to arrive from international sources. I bought the LEDs early from eBay well in advance but I did not want to spend time on sourcing parts instead of my studies so the remainder of the parts were sourced locally from a physical [JayCar Electronics Store](http://www.jaycar.com.au/), online with extremely fast shipping from [RS Components](http://au.rs-online.com/web/) and [OpenLab](http://openlab.com.au/shop/) which are all Australian sources.

The following table shows my BOM, this was by no means the cheapest way to gather the materials but my number one concern with this project was to get the parts ASAP for a good winter project after exams when I had some time to dedicate to it.
