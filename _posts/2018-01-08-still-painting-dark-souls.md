This is just a short update on my painting progress for Dark Souls. I went on my annual summer holiday to Torquay for 2 weeks and naturally it was crappy weather as usual so woohoo for inside hobbies!

<!--more-->

On holiday I didn't bring my block of wood for fear of ridicule from my family - "...why on earth would you bring a plank of wood?" so I had to get creative - I used an egg carton with the screws poked through the separators to prime and dry the models.

The titanite demon was probably the easiest of the lot to paint - the washes and drybrush did most of the work for me and I think it turned out great!

Anyway I was able to paint most of the rest of the base game enemy figures, here you go!
