I was given a great MagBook by Jonathan Parkyn called [How to Build a Robot] which although is a UK magazine, it's still a great resource to get started in robotics and I thought I'd give it a try as I haven't played with motors before.

## Bill of Materials
The provided BOM in the magazine has a few slight differences; they recommended a kit that contained similar components to these however I purchased them separately.

Components I already owned:

- Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller (Already Owned)
- Jumper wires (Already Owned)
- Breadboard

Other components:

- Arduino motor shield R3 ($40.78 - [RS Components][motor])
- Robot Car Chassis ($13.12 - eBay)
- Ultrasonic module HC-SR04 ($1.35 - eBay)
- Arduino-compatible analogue joystick ($1.58 - eBay)
- 2.1 x 5.5mm Male DC Power Plug to 9V Battery clip (x2 $1.05 - eBay)
- Switched 4xAA battery pack ($1.69 - eBay)

Components otherwise in the kit:

- GL5516 5mm Light Dependent Resistor (x20 $1.04 - eBay)
- VS1838 Universal Infrared Receiving Head (x10 $1.57 - eBay)
- PCB Mount tactile push button switch (x10 $1.00 - eBay)
- DC Infrared remote control ($1.46 - eBay)
- 5V Electromagnetic Piezo Active Buzzer (x10 $2.25 - eBay)

Just to play with (not used in final robot):

- Towerpro SG90 micro servo 9g (x4 $8.85 - eBay)
