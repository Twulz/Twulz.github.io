Today I'm repotting the Bird's Eye Chilli seedlings into their own pots and giving everything a good feed.

<!--more-->

I've already [replanted the tomatoes]({% post_url 2021-09-12-replanting-seedlings-tomatoes %}) but this week my Bunnings order arrived and I have some additional fertiliser to use when I repot the chillies.

Here are a few pictures of the plants on each level of my shelving on 26/09/21 so roughly 6 weeks after planting, starting with the bird's eye chillies above - it shows the big growth that's happened with the tomatoes (along with some new purchases I forgot to get out of the way!) and not much change in the other plants just yet.

Not much change on the strawberries and chillies front - but I'll replant some of them anyway.

One of these tomatoes is really struggling, not entirely sure why yet but hopefully will continue to grow and is just a late starter.

Interestingly, I think the bottom shelf gets more sun than the second-to-bottom so these plants are slightly bigger.

Right, now to the good stuff - I've bought some fertilliser since planting the tomatoes so I'll be using some of this in the replanting process (I'll just have to add some when I repot the tomatoes again).

In each pot I put approximately:
* Blood & Bone 10g
* Phosphorus 2g
* Tomato & Vegetable feed 10-15g
This is all slow release fertiliser which will just improve the soil on top of the potting mix (hopefully not entering fertiliser burn territory!) I'd just pile it into the pot with some potting mix and mix it all in, then put in the peat pot like I did for the tomatoes and refill.

Now for the lovely progress pictures - these are Bird's Eye Chillies:

Tomatoes, Cayenne chillies, strawberries (and some new chives):

I'm now crowding my shelves a bit much but the chillies have now taken prime position at the top and I reshuffled the tomatoes. I'm still waiting for the weather to get slightly better before I try moving my delicate plants outside.
