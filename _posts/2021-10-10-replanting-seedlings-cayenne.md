My replanting continues in this post where I finally repot the Cayenne Chillies and the tiny strawberry plants out of the seed trays and into their own pots.

First things first, here is a quick snap of all my plants I planted this year so far - this is on 8/10/21 so 2 months after planting the seeds, the Bird's Eye Chillies:

Tomatoes and more bird's eye chillies:

More tomatoes:

More tomatoes with the cayenne peppers in the middle, strawberries in the front and chives to the left.

First things first; these tomatoes are getting a bit big for the stand and I'm running out of room - time for them to graduate to outside. I also staked them up using some new tomato clips and some skewers so the main stem would grow more straight.

I cleared some room on the [garden net I built]({% post_url 2017-05-21-building-the-garden-net %}) so they'd be protected from the things that want to eat everything!

The weather is a lot better now but still I did a 2 day test to see if they had any reaction to the change in temperature before bringing the rest of them out.

I potted these up the same way as the [bird's eye chillies]({% post_url 2021-09-26-replanting-seedlings-birdseye %}) by first separating out the pots. These easily separated by hand this time so they were already beginning to break down!

I used the same amount of fertiliser as for the [bird's eye chillies]({% post_url 2021-09-26-replanting-seedlings-birdseye %}).

I also potted up the strawberries - I'm still not convinced these will be successful but may as well give it a go anyway! I planted them in a long planter box instead of separately.

So after all this potting my shelf is looking mighty crowded.

I still waited a couple of days to find the tomato experiment had been a success! So I moved the rest of the tomatoes out on 12/10/21 to give the plants inside a fighting chance.

A better view of the garden net all set up - the round pots are ready for the best of the chillies when they're ready.

Now the inside shelf is looking a whole lot better, everything is able to get a lot more sun.

And just some more closeups to compare to later - these are all bird's eye chillies.

More bird's eye chillies.
