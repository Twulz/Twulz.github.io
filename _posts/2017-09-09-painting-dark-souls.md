I kickstarted the Dark Souls Board Game and decided the minis would look better painted.

With [all my paints sorted]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-08-30-choosing-paints-for-dark-souls %}) I dove straight in to the painting. I decided to experiment a bit with the base coat colours - most of the mainly silver characters I went with grey but black is a really great way to make sure you get a good coat over the whole model, and sometimes if you don't spill paint all over the base it doesn't even need that much of a touch up too!

To prime without painting half of my backyard I used the same block of wood with holes drilled in it as I used for the [zombicide painting]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-01-20-zombicide-prep-prime %}) so I wouldn't also be priming half of my backyard.

Ornstein and Smough were probably my favourite bosses in Dark Souls 1 so I wanted to do them justice and spent -ages- on their paint job. In the end I'm fairly happy with them, but I wish I left them to be one of the last so I could make the mistakes on the other models.

After doing the sentinels though I am considering removing this bright gold colour in favour of a silver-grey base with highlights of gold - like how I did these sentinel bows.
