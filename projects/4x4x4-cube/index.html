				<p>My first AVR project was building an LED Cube, I began with a small 4x4x4 cube in the hopes of creating an 8x8x8 in the future. This was before I had created this blog but I have still attempted to document the process here.</p>
				
				<h3>Here are the posts I have made so far about this cube:</h3>
