##### Engineer, maker, crafter, do-er... I basically just like to make things.

I am a recent graduate from Science, Mechatronics Engineering and Computer Science here in Melbourne, Australia and I also have about a billion hobbies which mostly revolve around "making stuff". I decided to create this blog both as yet another project for myself and to keep it all a little more organised.

I currently work in software development mainly on the Salesforce platform

I really created this for myself so my apologies if it's not the greatest blog ever but I do hope one day somebody else will get something out of it!
