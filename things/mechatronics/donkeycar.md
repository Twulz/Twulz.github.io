Donkeycar is an open source platform to convert small scale (remote control) cars into self-driving cars. Donkeycar written in Python and is most often used with a Raspberry Pi and PiCam controlling an RC car by manipulating both steering and throttle.

After re-joining the hackerspacethis year I came across a group who are trying to get a DonkeyCar community going here in Melbourne. The first workshop these guys had run was for the Open Hardware Mini Conference in January and were now expanding to hopefully run a few more sessions on a more regular basis and other events such as race days to pit our DonkeyCars against each other!

I've decided to name my car "Basil Faulty" in tribute to Basil Fawlty from Fawlty Towers as I'm sure he's going to have many faults along the way...
